Reactracker App
The Reactracker App is a simple React.js application that allows users to track their income and expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter their goods, along with the respective amounts, and categorize them as either income (positive value) or expenses (negative value). The app then calculates the total income, total expenses, and displays the remaining balance.

The Reactracker App leverages the power of React's useReducer hook and Context API to manage and handle the state of the application, providing an efficient and scalable solution.

Features
Add Income and Expenses: Users can add their goods and amounts as income or expenses through the input form provided in the application.

Dynamic List: The application displays a dynamic list of added goods, showing their amounts and whether they are income or expenses. The list is automatically updated as the user adds new items.

Automatic Calculation: The Reactracker App automatically calculates the total income and total expenses based on the user's input.

Remaining Balance: The app calculates and displays the remaining balance by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Technologies Used
The Reactracker App is built using the following technologies:

React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
useReducer Hook: Used to manage state and handle state transitions efficiently.
Context API: Utilized to create a global state accessible by all components, providing a clean and scalable solution.
